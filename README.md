# Lending Club
> We work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Conclusions

From the data set we can conclude that the annual income ,revol_util and Grade variables affect the loan_status variable .
The lower annual income are more likely to default.
Grade E onwards are risky, and less numerous. Lending Club should either refuse loans or charge high interest rates.
The revol_util is observed to be higher for Charged_off customers as compared to that of Fully Paid customers.
